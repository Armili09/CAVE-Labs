The project was done by Armili Paturi and Anusha Devanga 

The project's objective is to create a digital replica of the university block. Users can explore the building and access its significant locations and attractions. This digital twin serves as a platform for providing virtual tours to visitors, prospective students, and others. The project utilized Unity and its packages to deliver an immersive virtual reality experience.
