# Metaversity
The project was done by Armili Paturi and Anusha Devanga 

The project's objective is to create a digital replica of the university block. Users can explore the building and access its significant locations and attractions. This digital twin serves as a platform for providing virtual tours to visitors, prospective students, and others. The project utilized Unity and its packages to deliver an immersive virtual reality experience.

Here is the link to the drive containing assets and models for each floor. These individual floors were then integrated into a cohesive project:
