The project aims to adapt a PC car driving simulation to Oculus Quest VR in twelve weeks. The plan includes three phases: VR integration setup and user interaction adaptation in the first three weeks, followed by four weeks for UI development, in-vehicle experience creation, and performance optimization. The last five weeks focus on cityscape design, traffic system implementation, environmental elements, testing, and finalization. The objective is to create a seamless, user-friendly VR experience by integrating the driving simulation, refining user interaction, and crafting a detailed cityscape with traffic elements within the specified time frame.
